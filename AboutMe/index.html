I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided by the instructor for this project. I understand that 
copying source code from any other source, providing source code to another student, or leaving my code on a public web site 
constitutes cheating. I acknowledge that if I am found in violation of this policy this may result in a zero grade, a 
permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs): Although there were a lot of tedious tasks and it took a little while to figure out, I had fun 
completing this assignment. I have a lot of experience with front-end development because of where I work but we use Webflow 
which is a no-code development software so it was nice to get back to the basics and manually write the code and script for 
this assignment. At first, I wasn't sure how to complete the extra credit task that asked us to make the modal portrait but 
after doing my own research, I was able to figure it out and that was a lot of fun. I have very limited experience with 
JavaScript so that extra credit task was really beneficial for me.

                <p>This poem was inspired by my life. It highlights a hobby of mine, my personality, and something significant in my life.</p>

                <p class="poem">Fields of grass full of activity,<br>
                    A gentle heart, overflowing with love,<br>
                    New life on the way.</p>

                    <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
                </header>

                <p>The thing I'm probably the most interested in are sports. I grew up playing all kinds of sports but mainly basketball and football. Recently, I was on a men's basketball team at my local rec center. We placed third in the final standings. My favorite basketball team is the Boston Celtics (no, I'm not a bandwagon fan. I've been a fan since I was 10 which was 16 years ago).</p>
                <p>Something else I'm interested in are comic books. Particularly Marvel Comics. I didn't grow up reading comic books but I've always loved sci-fi and superheros. A few years ago I decided to give comic books a try and I've fallen in love with them. I've started a small collection and plan to increase that collection over the years... if my wallet allows it.</p>
                <p>Another things I'm interested in are video games. I love playing video games with my friends but they usually like to play shooter games and if I'm being honest, I'm not very good at those types of games. So when I'm not playing shooter games with them, I usually play single-player games. Currently my favorite game is The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p>
